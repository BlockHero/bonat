      "6. You are genuinely so cute, even though you won't agree, and act sigma and non chalant but deep down you are still a silly & cute girl. Whenever you do some random shi, it always makes me smile. Your smile always makes me blush (yes I'm gay) And Your hairs looks good on you and your boboness nose, it looks cute and I absolutely love your real face, remember I saw it when you showed me your lipsync videos..",

You usually don't make big efforts but when you do it really makes me feel like cumming in my pants (And no I'm not taking about esex for now) Like sometimes you will make videos for me or sometimes send me a selfie or video without me asking for it. And sometimes random games and ideas you pull up with.",
      "10. You are my always my first thought, whenever something happens I always tell you about it first, like when I had accident I told you about it 😭, and whenever I get money I always show you. Even when I'm going to bed I wanna make you my final thought before sleeping and when I wake up... It's always you who I talk w first.",
